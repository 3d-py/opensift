The open-source SIFT library available here is implemented in C using the OpenCV open-source computer vision library and includes functions for computing SIFT features in images, matching SIFT features between images using kd-trees, and computing geometrical image transforms from feature matches using RANSAC.  The library also includes functionality to import and work with image features from both [David Lowe's SIFT executable](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/keypoints/) and [the Oxford VGGâ€™s affine covariant feature detectors](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/). The images below depict some of this functionality.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Open-Source SIFT Library"}
